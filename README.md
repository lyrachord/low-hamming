# Low Hamming key recovery attack

In C/, "make" and then ./o.o. If list does not exist, generate it with "make list && ./list.o" and save output to precomp/<block_size>-<max_weight_per_block>

## Factoring Unbalanced Moduli with Known Bits 

### ICISC 2009, Eric Brier, David Naccache, Mehdi Tibouchi

  LLL method.
  Unbalanced n = pq > q^3. Factorize when (i) 2log(q) contiguous bits of p are known, (ii) two chunks of known bits of p totaling 1.5 log(q) bits.


## Implicit Factoring: On Polynomial Time Factoring Given Only an Implicit Hint
### PKC 2009, Alexander May, Maike Ritzenhofen

  Good introduction.
  Not necessarily balanced N=pq, factorize with access to an oracle that outputs N'=p'q' such that p,p' share the t LSBs.
  We have t >= k/(k-1) alpha where k queries have been made, and the outputs are k moduli N_1, ... , N_k, each with log(q_i) = alpha.
  TODO: Lattice reduction of section 3.

  Extension of May et al PKC 2009. Same problem, improved results.

## Factoring RSA moduli with weak prime factors
### C2SI-Berger2015 

  A prime p is called weak if there exist parameters a, u_0, u_1, ... , u_k, M_1, ... , M_k such that ap = u_0 + u_1M_1 + ... + u_kM_k.
  This may yield our results: a = 1, u_0 = 1, u_i = 1, M_i = 2^i for some index i\in I.
  TODO: Check bounds on parameters.
  Does not cover the case "HD(p,q) small". 

## Factoring RSA Modulus Using Prime Reconstruction from Random Known Bits
### AFRICACRYPT 2010, Miatra, Sarkar, Sen Gupta


  N = pq balanced, when some random subset of the bits are known in the LSB halves. And give directions for MSB.

## On Factoring Arbitrary Integers with Known Bits
### 2007 Workshop "Kryptologie in Theorie und Praxis"

  TODO:
  "Rivest and Shamir [RS86] showed in 1985, that for an RSA-modulus N = pq an amount of 1/3 log N of the bits of p is sufficient to factor N. This result was improved by Coppersmith [Cop96] in 1996 to 3/10 log N bits, and in 1997 again by Coppersmith [Cop97] to 1/4 log N bits. In 1999, Boneh, Durfee and Howgrave-Graham [BDHG99] generalized the Coppersmith result to moduli of the form N=p^k q. They showed that k/(k+1)^2 log N bits are sufficient to find the factorization of N in polynomial time. One should notice that this result coincides with the one of Coppersmith for the RSA case, where  k = 1."

## Twenty Years of Attacks on the RSA Cryptosystem
### 1999 Dan Boneh

  Nice reading. 
  Theorem 10: (Coppersmith)
  Given the log(n)/4 LBSs or the log(n)/4 MSBs of p, one can factorize RSA moduli (note that this is RSA, not factoring, i.e. it uses ed=1 mod phi(n)).



## A Coding-Theoretic Approach to Recovering Noisy RSA Keys
### Asiacrypt 2012

  Cold boot attacks, when a key is recovered but allowing error in some bits. I.e. recover N=pq from N=(p+e)(q+e') where e,e' are of small Hamming weight.
  In the introduction they describe a very similar algorithm to ours (Correcting Errors in RSA Private Keys, see below)


## Correcting Errors in RSA Private Keys
### Crypto 2010

  TODO. The low Hamming hypothesis reduces to this (where the case that the recovered "noisy" key is p=0, and we want to "correct" h bits)...


## Using LLL-Reduction for Solving RSA and Factorization Problems: A Survey
### Alexander May, chapter of the book The LLL Algorithm: Survey and Applications

  Nice read. TODO.
